## Interface and Composition Design

Composition goes beyond the mechanics of type embedding and is more than just a paradigm. It is the key for maintaining stability in your software by having the ability to adapt to the data and transformation changes that are coming.

## Notes

* This is much more than the mechanics of type embedding.
* Declare types and implement workflows with composition in mind.
* Understand the problem you are trying to solve first. This means understanding the data.
* The goal is to reduce and minimize cascading changes across your software.
* Interfaces provide the highest form of composition.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Using the template, declare a set of concrete types that implement the set of predefined interface types. Then create values of these types and use them to complete a set of predefined tasks.
